    Hello I Am Fernando, I am currently a Pursuit Fellow who is working his way on to becoming a Software Engineer. 

    I needed to create a app/site as a project which I have decided to do it about anime, anime quotes specically because for two reasons.

    1. Anime is amazing and I enjoy it a lot and kind of grew up with it, honestly impacted my life a bit.

    2. Some anime quotes hit hard and deep while others may just be comical.

    Anime has so many different genres for all types of viewers so even though mainstream ones may be about gaining power and super human abilities or a race of non humans
    there are also ones about weight lifting, romance, sports, everyday life or just real life situations the list goes on. Which has lead me to creating the project.

     The anime quote quiz type game was created through my inspiration for anime and its impact towards me. 

     Here is a quiz game where you the user can pick out of 10 animes not 1 but 10 and you will need to type in what your guess is after selecting which anime out of 10
      random ones that will display in the drop box. 

      Then hit the button next to it afterwards 10 random quotes will appear from that anime title you have chosen. 

      Enjoy the gifs and I hope you enjoy this quiz game! 

      P.S I chose gifs from the big three and also Goku because dbz is one of the most impactful animes in both old and newer generations. :)
