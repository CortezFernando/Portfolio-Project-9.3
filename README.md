## Lab Setup

### Getting started

Anime Quiz Game. Here you have a index.html where I have a h1 tags and h2 tag, created 4 img tags with the source link for all four gifs used.

Inside the index.html has two links as well where I created a link rel tag for quotes.js and a script tag for style.ss is also linked to index.html file.

Inside the About.html is about me which is also created and linked to index.html where you can click to read a little about myself and why I chose this project.

All the designs you will see is in style.css including buttons and button colors, background colors, fonts and so on.

In quotes.js folder we have our functions, fetch, link to api. I created A for loop to go through an array of quotes. 

I have created addEventListners document.querySelectors and also both setAttributes and createElement.
